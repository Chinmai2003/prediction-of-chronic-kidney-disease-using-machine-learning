# prediction of chronic kidney disease using machine learning
 Chronic Kidney Disease or CKD is one of the most prevalent disease Which influence humans on a larger scale and proves to be fatal as it remains dormant unless irreversible damages have been made to the kidney of an individual. Progression of CKD is related to variety of great complications,including increased incidence of various disorders, anemia, hyperlipidemia, nerve damage, pregnancy complications and even complete kidney failure. It is critical to have reliable techniques at predicting CKD in its early stages. Machine learning (ML) techniques are excellent in predicting CKD. This project offers a methodology for predicting CKD status using clinical data, which incorporates data preprocessing, a technique for managing missing values, data aggregation, and feature extraction. Millions of people die from this disease every year. Diagnosing CKD is a cumbersome task as there are no major symptom that can be used as a benchmark to detect the disease. We have used a Machine learning approach for predicting if a patient has CKD. This project involves different ML algorithms such as XGB Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machi
